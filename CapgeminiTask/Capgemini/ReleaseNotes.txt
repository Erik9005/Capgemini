Release 1. 2021-02-03.

----------

Received the task and thought about the overall structure, 
and if I wanted to change or add projects/items it would be
easy. 

----------

So I created the following projects:

Commons which has shared items that all other solutions 
can access. The Commons project could also be made a Nuget package
for easy access from other solutions. 

DatabaseRepository which has the DbContext and migrations.

RestApi which communicates with the Web.Ui and backend logic.

Services which orchestrates and communicates with the logic.
In this case the logic is only a few lines of code 
(saving and getting persons from the db), but when the logic
grows bigger it could be put in the Commons project and called
by the service.

Web.Ui which shows the view to the client and communicates with the
RestApi project via Jquery.

----------

Got stuck on retrieving data from the RestApi via Jquery. Had to 
add Cors in the Startup.

----------

Set the Web.Ui and RestApi as startup projects. Or host them manually
in IIS. Would need more time for authentication, so it has no authentication
in this release. Also set the ConnectionString in the CapgeminiConfig.yaml
configuratin before running.

----------

UnitTests, logging, WindowsService, more features/logic and authentication 
can be added in the future.
